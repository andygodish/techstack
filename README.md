This is a public repository containing research and documentation pertaining to troublshooting I do on a daily basis as a DevOps/Infrastructure/Software engineer. It is meant to be a context base that I can provide to AI when troubleshooting issues I run into when using Open Source software. The idea for this repo comes directly from an [X post](https://x.com/aaditsh/status/1945680357724221605) I stumbled upon. The example repository from that video can be found [here](https://github.com/daveshap/PostLaborEconomics).

The goal is to create a knowledge base that can be used to quickly reference solutions to common problems. Too often, I find myself repeating the same research when troubleshooting issues, resulting in wasted time. By documenting these solutions, I hope to streamline my workflow and make it easier to find answers to common problems that I've already tackled. 

## Structure

The `research` directory is the crux of this repository. It contains pdf reports generated by Deep Research tools. This is research directed by humans and automatically carried out by machine, representing the equivalet of thousands of hours worth of work.
